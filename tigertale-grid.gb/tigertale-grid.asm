; The main additions in this example are moving a player in response to input (ProcessInput), and checking the tilemap
;  entries to determine if attempted moves are into valid spaces based on tile ID (GetTileID). Note that instead of using an
;  automatically generated tilemap as in the background-filemap example, the tilemap is pre-constructed with tiles organized
;  such that walkable tiles start at 0 and are sequential to simplify the collision check.
