; Grid Collision Example for the Nintendo Game Boy
; by Dave VanEe 2022
; Tested with RGBDS 0.6.0
; License: CC0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

; This example builds on the following examples:
;  - background-tilemap (except using a manually constructed tilemap)
;  - vblank/oamdma/sprite
;  - joypad

; The main additions in this example are moving a player in response to input (ProcessInput), and checking the tilemap
;  entries to determine if attempted moves are into valid spaces based on tile ID (GetTileID). Note that instead of using an
;  automatically generated tilemap as in the background-filemap example, the tilemap is pre-constructed with tiles organized
;  such that walkable tiles start at 0 and are sequential to simplify the collision check.
